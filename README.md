# burger-to-x
Todayâ€™s assignment is  X-menu so the lines that we have done looks like = when the user hover over it your lines should 
move around to look like X.

Struggles:
-Today I have struggle to make both burger lines make the "x" perfect. I mean, to cross exactly in the middle, with the correct inclination and taking into consideration that both must be the same size. I think the key point was to figuring out how to use "translate" and realize the effects of x,y. 
-One more time, this is about families(father and sons) and the correct order makes things works. If I can use a rule that applies for all, it is better than write a rule for every single piece.

Satisfied about:
-I was able to fix the axis for the "X" to cross in the middle!
-I realized that less is more, and some parts of my code didn't make the difference at all (so I have to make them invisible).
